# Bowling Car!
An amazing game of cars and bowling! Grupo Peko has developed it as a response to the Racing Car project of the Physics 2 course at CITM university. We wanted to innovate compared to what was presented to us as a prototype, and this is our proposal. Enjoy it!

## Features
- Fully working 3D Car.
- 4 Bowling Levels.
- Lives! 10 resets will make you lose the game!
- Boosters! Try to get a little speed boost in order to beat the level!

## Controls
- Directional Arrows: Move your Car!
- R: Reset the Actual Level.
- Shift: Hand Break!
- F1: Show Colliders and Sensors.
- F2: Go to the next Level.

## Rules
- You must crash against the red pillar to pass the level. If you can't, use the reset button to start over!
- Once you have accelerated, you will get to go through a blue cube. When touched, you will lose the ability to control your vehicle, so aim well!
- As well! On the ground there are speed boosters to help you complete the levels. Find a way to use them efficiently!
- Enjoy it!
